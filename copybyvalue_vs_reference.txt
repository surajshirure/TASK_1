Copy by value:
 1. In this, value of variable is directly copied in other variable. But they do not point to the same memory location/address. They are not connected i.e. changes in one variable does not reflect in other.

 2. Primitive data types are copied by value number,string,boolean

 3. consider following example;

    var x =17;
    var y =19;
    var a = x;
    var b = y;
    x = 14
    y = 20
    console.log(x,y,a,b);

    output is 14,20,17,19

    here though value of variable x & y changed later, it is not reflected in variable a & b as they do not share the same memory location i.e. they are connected.

Copy by reference:

 1. In this, value of variable is not directly copied in other variable instead address of memory laction get copied. they do point to the same memory location/address. They are connected i.e. changes in one variable does reflect in other.

 2. non- Primitive data types are copied by reference i.e. object, array

 3. consider following example;

    let user:{
    name: ravi
    }

    let admin = user;

    admin.name = shyam;

    console.log(user.name);

    output- shyam

    here though we made changes in key of var admin,it is reflected in that of var user as they do share the same memory location i.e. they are connected.
